# Welcome to my Deep Learning Repository

## About This Repository

I am open-sourcing the code for my published research work to benefit the broader research community. Currently, this repository contains implementation of classification algorithms, which I believe will be very helpful for researchers and practitioners in the field.

## Contents

- Covid-19 Classification using X-rays Images
- Early Diagnose of Alzheimer's Disease using PET images
- Vision Transformer comparision and technical discussion 

## Collaboration

I'm open to research collaborations. If you're interested in working together or have any questions about the implementations, please feel free to reach out.

## Published Work
1. Computer‐aided diagnosis of COVID‐19 disease from chest X‐ray images integrating deep feature extraction ( https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12919)
2. Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease Using 18F-FDG PET With Soften Latent Representation (10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3418508)



Thank you for visiting my repository. I hope you find the code useful for your research!
